# MNIST Neural Network Experiment

This repository contains code to train and evaluate a simple neural network model on the MNIST dataset using different optimizers (Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop) and learning rates.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

`pip install torch torchvision matplotlib`


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    `git clone https://github.com/Bavalpreet/ADL-5500.git`

    `cd mnist-neural-network`


2. Run the `mnist_experiment.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the models:

    Jupyter Notebook `mnist_experiment.ipynb`


3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train models with different optimizers and learning rates and visualize the results.
